\subsection*{Jan 23 2024}

\begin{itemize}
		  \item \textbf{Database:} Collection of \underline{related} stored data (Ex. KU database by Microsoft Access
		  \item Having multiple copies of the same data can lead to flawed, contradictory info. 
		  \item Org. can benefit by having their data integrated into a single database.
		  \item \textbf{Integrated Database:} Collection of related data that can be used simultaneously by many departments and users in an enterprise
		  \item \textbf{Metadata:} Data about data
		  \item \textbf{``System Catalog'':} How all of the tables are related to each other/a list of them all
		  \item \textbf{Database Administrator (DBA):} Responsible for creating and maintaining the database
		  \item \textbf{Database Management Systems (DBMS):} A s/w package that allows creating and maintaining databases. All access to the database is controlled by a DBMS
		  \item Apps that are written in java, c++, etc. go through DBMS and can then present data in the 
					 form each program expects 
		  \item \textbf{End Users:} People who use the data to perform their jobs
		  \item \textbf{(*)Advantages of Integrated Database:} Sharing of data, control of redundancy, data consistency, improved data standards (Who needs to know what in each table), better data security (Ensures all data is entered correctly), improved data integrity (Same as last adv.), balancing of conflicting requirements, faster development of new apps., better data accessibility, economy of scale (Easy to modify database), more control over concurrency (More control over events that happen at the same time), better backup and recovery procedures (One repository makes less redundencies)
\end{itemize}

								\item Object oriented model (O.O Model) - 1990s 
								\item Object relational mode: Object oriented capabilities in a relational database
					 \end{itemize}
		  \item \textbf{Data Warehouse:}
					 \begin{itemize}
								\item 1990s, lots of data that can be used to do statistics or, predictions to help business. 
								\item Built to store large quantities of historical data
								\item Enables fast complex quries across all of the data
								\item Typically using OLAP (Online \underline{Analytical} Processing)
								\item \underline{Note:} DB is typically for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
					 \end{itemize}
		  \item \textbf{Internet Access:} to a network of databases (Web based data base, publicaly avaliable)

		  \item \textbf{\underline{4 Levels of abstraction when discussing database:}}
					 \begin{itemize}
								\item \textbf{Real World} (For mini world or universe of discourse): Find out what 
										  actually occurs. You understand enterprise
								\item \textbf{Conceptual Model} (For mini world or universe of discourse): Start

								\item Data sub language commands can be embedded into host program, a general/high level
										  purpose language such as C, C++, Java, COBOL, ADA, Fortran 
										  \underline{instead of directly interacting} with SQL, etc.
					 \end{itemize}
		  \item Database should be designed for \underline{scalability} for future needs of an organization. 
					 Developor needs to develop a \underline{true conceptual model}

					 (*)Know the steps and be able to explain each step of the process independently
					 \begin{enumerate}
								\item \textbf{Analyze User Environment:} Check current apps, exsisting documents,
										  interview user needs
								\item \textbf{Develop Conceptual Model:} Identify entities, attributes, relationships. 
										  Types of applications and transactions.

																\underline{Entity,Relationship, and Attributes}
										  \end{itemize}
								\item \textbf{Chose DBMS:} Choose an appropriate DBMS (MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, etc.)
										  \begin{itemize}
													 \item Single user VS. Multiple users
													 \item Central database VS. Distributed databases

								\item \textbf{External Level (External Schema):} The way users thnk about data.
										  Ex. Name of students from Dr. Shims class, Courses Shim taught F22. 
										  (*)Many number of External schema for a single database.
								\item \textbf{Logical Level:} Middle mapping that shows independence between
										  external and physical levels. Only (*)one logical schema as its the pairing 
										  designs of the many tables. Includes 
										  \underline{entities, attributes, relationships, semantics, etc.}. Supported
										  by the internal model
								\item \textbf{Internal Level:} The way data is actually stored 
										  using \underline{data structures}
										  and \underline{file organizations}. Only (*)one internal schema. Physical
										  implementation of the database.
								\item This architecture creates good \underline{data independence} (Upper levels
										  are unaffected by changes to the lower levels
								\item \textbf{(*)Logical Data Independence:} Immunity of external models
										  to changes in the logical model
								\item \textbf{(*)Physical Data Independence:} Immunity of the logical model to changes in 
										  the internal model

Chapter 3

\begin{itemize}
		  \item \textbf{Entity Relationship Model:} Allows the designer to express conceptual properties
					 of the database in enterprise schema. Model describes 
					 \underline{entities, attributes, relationships.}
					 Uses its own ER Diagram.
		  \item \textbf{Entity:} Object of interest: Person, place, event, object. Can be physcial or abstract
		  \item \textbf{Entity Instance:} Represents particular object, person, class, student, etc.
					 Ex (John Doe, 35, 504-26-8585)
		  \item \textbf{Entity Type:} Representation of the data model of a category of entities. Described
					 by its name and attributes. 
		  \item \textbf{Entity Set:} Collection of entities of the same type
		  \item \textbf{Attributes:} of an entity represent defining properties of entity type
					 \begin{itemize}
								\item \textbf{Simple:} (age) or \textbf{Composite:} (1. name = first name + last name, 
										 2. address = street + city + state + zip)
							   \item \textbf{Single Valued:} (age, SSN) or \textbf{Multi Valued [use double oval]:}
										  (degree earned, color of car, email address)
								\item \textbf{Stored:} (birthday) or \textbf{Derived [use dashed oval]:}
										  (age)
					 \end{itemize}
		  \item An entity instance will have a value for each attribute. Ex (12345, Doe, John, CS, 65)
		  \item \textbf{Domain:} Set of values permiteed for each attribute. Ex age:[16,70],
					 GPA:[0,4.0], credits:[0,120]
		  \item \textbf{Null:} No value, the values of some attributes for some instances may have this value.
					 \underline{Databse should not leave attributes empty, use null}. DOES NOT MEAN 0, just 
					 place holder
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Feb 15 2024}

\begin{itemize}
		  \item \textbf{Key:} minimal subset (\underline{no proper subset of the key attributes
					 is a unique identifier}) of attributes that uniquely identify an entity. Ex.
					StuID is a key for the Student entity
		 \item \textbf{Candidate Key:} The several keys an entity can have. Keys potenialy used as the key
		 \item \textbf{Primary Key:} One key selected to uniquely identify entities. Ex. Car VIN
		 \item \textbf{Alternate Keys:} All of the other keys for an entity. Ex. Car model, year, make, etc. 
		 \item \textbf{Super Key:} A non minimal key. Ex. any key that has the primary key (unique
					identifier key), plus other identifiers. \underline{Default superkey:} the set of
					 all attributes
		 \item \textbf{Composite Key:} A key consisting of more than one attribute
		 \item \underline{(*)No primary key value can be null}
		 \item \textbf{Foreign Key:} Primary key of another relation, pointer to another relation.
					A key that can be used in multiple tables. Ex. \underline{Inventory table} has column: Vender-Code,
					 \underline{Vendor table} has column Venter-Code as well.
		 \item A table is a set of rows/specific objects/tuples
		 \item \textbf{Relationships:} Connections or interactions among entity instances
		 \item \textbf{Relationship Type:} The common properties of certain relationships 
		 \item \textbf{Relationship Set:} The cellection of relationships of that type
		 \item \textbf{(*)Degree:} The number of participating entity types (Unary - 1, Binary - 2, Tirnary - 3).
					(*)Generally keep to \underline{2}. Need to specify:
					 \begin{itemize}
								\item Cardinality
								\item Connectivity
								\item Mandatory/Optional
					 \end{itemize}
		  \item \textbf{Relationship set of degree n:} A subset of an n-ary relation of the form
		  \item \textbf{(*)Cardinality:} The number of entities to which another entity can map under
					 that relationship (min, max)
		  \item \textbf{Connectivity:} One to one (1:1), one to many (1:N), many to many (N:N)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Feb 15 2024}

\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{(*)Participation Constraints (Uese the min values of cardinarlity):}
					\begin{itemize}
							\item \underline{Total Participation:} Every memeber of entity set must participate
							in relationship, uses double
							\item \underline{Partial Participation:} Some members of entity set may not participate
							in the relationship, uses single line
					\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Roles:} indicate recursive relationship, the same 2 entities are realted in 
						2 different ways
			\item When data is needed to be stored, we would not be interested in data unless we had a 
			related entity already in the database. Ex. dont need sales order data unless we had 
			customer data. 
			\item \textbf{Strong Entities:} Entity Y can not exist without some X entity. X is a strong entity
			\item \textbf{Weak Entities:} In the example above, Y is the weak entity. Y must then also
			have total participation in its relationaship set with X
			\item \textbf{Identifying Relationship:} The relationship type that relates a weak entity type to its 
			owner.
			\item \textbf{Partial Key (Discriminator):} Weak entity type normally has this, 
			the set of attributes that can 
			uniquely identify weak entities that are related to the same owner entity
\end{itemize}
